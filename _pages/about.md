Hello! This is Yuting Liu (刘禹廷 in Chinese). I am a first-year PhD student at the [Software College](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/) of [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu.cn/), Shenyang, China. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof Guibing Guo](https://guoguibing.github.io/cn/) at [DSLab](https://www.dslab.org.cn/) and [AR Qiang Liu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~qiangliu?language=en). Before that, I earned my B.E. degree in 2022 at the same institute. I am honored to work closely with [Dr. Jinghao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yXhkbsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Yizhou Dang](https://kinggugu.github.io/).

My research interests include multimodal recommendation systems (RS) and personalized large language models (LLM). Please feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions or seeking collaborations.
